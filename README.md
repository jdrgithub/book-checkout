# ️ Library Checkout System (Python OOP Demo)

This is a simple **Library Checkout System** built in Python using object-oriented programming principles. It simulates library operations including user creation, book management, lending and returns, and includes a full test suite using `unittest`.

Originally written as part of a technical interview, this project has been expanded into a clean, testable, and extensible demo.
